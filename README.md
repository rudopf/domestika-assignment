⚙️ Known Gaps & Assumptions
Prototype uses static data for demo purposes; future state assumes LLM integration (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Claude).

User profiles are mocked — full personalization and community mapping depend on Domestika’s learner metadata.

Feedback and co-creation features are illustrated through scripted flows, not real-time generation.

No full UI polish — priority was demonstrating clarity of product thinking and core utility.
